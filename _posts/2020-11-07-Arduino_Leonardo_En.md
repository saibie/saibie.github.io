In order to proceed with this project, you need preparations that can perform the following roles:

1. A combination switch hardware
1. A device that send the electric signal of the combination switch to our computer

#### A combination switch hardware

In many posts about installing combination switches in Korea,
they are posted that "I picked the combination switch up in a junkyard."
But, I do not have Geographic advantages like that.
So, I decided to buy an used combination switch.

[Search combination switches in G market in Korea](http://browse.gmarket.co.kr/search?keyword=%EC%BD%A4%EB%B9%84%EC%8A%A4%EC%9C%84%EC%B9%98)

Honestly, the above link is for Koreans.
I just want to show where I bought the switch.

#### A device that send the electric signal

If we search "making / installing ETS2 combination switch" in Google,
there are many posts and videos for working combination switches.
The authors said or post in common that **I made it with Arduino Leonardo.**

If you know about Arduino well, you accept that saying.
But, if you do not know about Arduino like me when searched at first time, you have to study about Arduino.
There are many posts about Arduino.
I want to recommand a post which is best for me, but it's for Koreans.

Because I am not an expert of Arduino,
there are many posts and videos which are made by experts of Arduino,
and our purpose is not to apply Arduino variously,
it is posted about installing a combination switch in this blog.
If you are not expert for Arduino, just remember Arduino **Leonardo**.

The next post will be about the process of recognizing the electric signal of the used combination switch.
